## Overview  
This tutorial will cover the tidyr and dplyr packages created by the mythical code wizard [Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley) of ggplot2 fame. The following topics will be covered:

1. **Basics of tidyr and dplyr**    
    + Data frames and data tables  
    + Piping and chaining  
2. **Processing and manipulating data**  
    + Reshaping, subsetting, and joins  
3. **Analyzing data with dplyr**
    + Summary and window functions  
    + Grouping data  
4. **Using using dplyr with ggplot2**  
5. **Writing functions with dplyr and tidyr**  
6. **Using dplyr to connect and analyze external databases**

## Getting Started  
Install and load the following packages:
```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=T,warning=FALSE, message=F}
## Install packages if needed
# install.packages(dplyr)
# install.packages(tidyr)
# install.packages(ggplot2)

# Load packages
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read in FAO data
fao<-read.csv(file = 'data/FAO_1950to2012_111014.csv',stringsAsFactors = F)
load(file = 'data/DBdata_020215.Rdata')
```

### Why use dplyr and tidyr?
1. **Speed** - dplyr and tidyr are *really* fast  
2. **Readability** - the code syntax is straightforward and easy to read  
3. **Chaining** - *never break the chain*. More on this later  
4. **Integrates with ggplot2** - plot your data in the same workflow that you manipulate it with
5. **Can be used to analyze external databases without knowledge of additional database query languages** 

## Basics of dplyr and tidyr  
### Data frames and data tables
Although technically two separate packages, **dplyr** and **tidyr** were designed to work together and can basically be thought of as a single package. They are designed to work with data frames as is, but it is generally a good idea to convert data frames to table data using the `tbl_df()` function, particularly when working with large datasets.

```{r, eval=F,echo=T}
## Using the iris dataset, consider what happens with the following command
fao # all entries are printed in your console
head(fao) # top five entries are printed in your console, columns wrap and can be difficult to follow if working with many variables
summary(fao)

## With dplyr
fao<-tbl_df(fao) # convert to table data
fao # now top 10 rows are shown along with data type of each variable. Variables that do not fit in console window are shown below.
glimpse(fao) # view all columns 
summary(fao)
```

### Main verbs of dplyr and tidyr
In general, it is good practice to have your data organized in a "tidy" format where each column is a variable and each row is an observation.Tidyr and dplyr are designed to help manipulate data sets, allowing you to convert between *wide* and *long* formats, fill in missing values and combinations, separate or merge multiple columns, rename and create new variables, and summarize data according to grouping variables. 

Dplyr and tidyr rely on the following main verbs:  

* Tidyr
    + `gather()` and `spread()` convert data between wide and long format  
    + `separate()` and `unite()` separate a single column into multiple columns and vice versa  
    + `complete()` turns implicit missing values in explicit missing values by completing missing data combinations

* Dplyr
    + `arrange()` order rows by value of a column  
    + `rename()` rename columns  
    + `filter()` subset data based on logical criteria  
    + `select()` select certain columns  
    + `mutate()` create a new variable/column  
    + `summarize()` summarize data into a single row of values  
    + `group_by()` group data by common variables for performing calculations

Note that *unquoted* variable names are used in tidyr and dplyr functions. We'll use these verbs to process the raw FAO landings data into a more manageable format  
```{r, eval=F,echo=T}
# Let's convert the fao data from it's current wide format to a long format using gather()
df<-gather(fao,key='Year',value = 'Catch',starts_with('X')) # select all columns starting with X

# Now let's rename the columns to more manageable names (new name=old name)
df<-rename(df,country=Country..Country.,
           commname=Species..ASFIS.species.,
           sciname=Species..ASFIS.species..1,
           spcode=Species..ASFIS.species..2,
           spgroup=Species..ISSCAAP.group.,
           spgroupname=Species..ISSCAAP.group..1,
           regionfao=Fishing.area..FAO.major.fishing.area.,
           regionfaoname=Fishing.area..FAO.major.fishing.area..1,
           unit=Measure..Measure.,year=Year,catch=Catch)

# get rid of the spgroup, regionfaoname, and unit columns
df<-select(df,-spgroup,-regionfaoname,-unit)

# arrange entries by country, scientific name, fao region and year
df<-arrange(df,country,sciname,regionfao,year)

```

#### Piping and chaining code
While the above workflow is perfectly acceptable, dplyr allows you to use the *pipe* operator to *chain* functions together. Chaining code allows you to streamline your workflow and make it easier to read.

When using the `%>%` operator, first specify the data frame that all following functions will use. For the rest of the chain the data frame argument can be omitted from the remaining functions.

Consider the same process as before only using pipes and a single chain:

```{r,eval=F,echo=T}

df<- fao %>%
  gather(key='Year',value = 'Catch',starts_with('X')) %>%
  rename(country=Country..Country.,
         commname=Species..ASFIS.species.,
         sciname=Species..ASFIS.species..1,
         spcode=Species..ASFIS.species..2,
         spgroup=Species..ISSCAAP.group.,
         spgroupname=Species..ISSCAAP.group..1,
         regionfao=Fishing.area..FAO.major.fishing.area.,
         regionfaoname=Fishing.area..FAO.major.fishing.area..1,
         unit=Measure..Measure.,year=Year,catch=Catch) %>%
  select(-spgroup,-regionfaoname,-unit) %>%
  arrange(country,sciname,regionfao,year)

```

Before moving on we need to do some quick data cleaning
```{r,eval=F,echo=T}
# strip the X off the front of all the year values and convert that variable to numeric
df$year<-as.numeric(gsub(df$year,pattern = 'X', replacement = ''))

# remove the "Totals" vales
df<-filter(df,!(country %in% c('Totals - Quantity (number)','Totals - Quantity (tonnes)')))
```

Here are a few more examples of chaining code to select, filter, and arrange datasets  

```{r,eval=F,echo=T}


df %>%
  filter(country=='Canada' & year==2012) %>%
  select(year,country,commname,catch) %>%
  arrange(catch)


The `df$spcode` variable actually consists of 5 individual parts.
